## LibDriver TCS34725

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/tcs34725/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The TCS34725 device provides a digital return of red, green, blue (RGB), and clear light sensing values. An IR blocking filter, integrated on-chip and localized to the color sensing photodiodes, minimizes the IR spectral component of the incoming light and allows color measurements to be made accurately. The high sensitivity, wide dynamic range, and IR blocking filter make the TCS34725 an ideal color sensor solution for use under varying lighting conditions and through attenuating materials. The TCS34725 color sensor has a wide range of applications including RGB LED backlight control, solid-state lighting, health/fitness products, industrial process controls and medical diagnostic equipment. In addition, the IR blocking filter enables the TCS34725 to perform ambient light sensing (ALS). Ambient light sensing is widely used in display-based products such as cell phones, notebooks, and TVs to sense the lighting environment and enable automatic display brightness for optimal viewing and power savings. The TCS34725, itself, can enter a lower-power wait state between light sensing measurements to further reduce the average power consumption.

LibDriver TCS34725 is a full-featured driver of TCS34725 launched by LibDriver.It provides RGB color reading, brightness reading, brightness interrupt detection and other functions. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_tcs34725_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
uint16_t red, green, blue, clear;

res = tcs34725_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    tcs34725_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = tcs34725_basic_read((uint16_t *)&red, (uint16_t *)&green, (uint16_t *)&blue, (uint16_t *)&clear);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)tcs34725_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: red is %d.\n", red);
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: green is %d.\n", green);
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: blue is %d.\n", blue);
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: clear is %d.\n", clear);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)tcs34725_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example interrupt

```C
#include "driver_tcs34725_interrupt.h"

void gpio_irq(void)
{
    g_flag = 1;
}

res = tcs34725_interrupt_init(TCS34725_INTERRUPT_MODE_EVERY_RGBC_CYCLE, 10, 100);
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}
res = gpio_interrupt_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    (void)tcs34725_interrupt_deinit();

    return 1;
}

...

g_flag = 0;
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)

    res = tcs34725_interrupt_read((uint16_t *)&red, (uint16_t *)&green, (uint16_t *)&blue, (uint16_t *)&clear);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: read data failed.\n");
        (void)tcs34725_interrupt_deinit();
        (void)gpio_interrupt_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: red is %d.\n", red);
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: green is %d.\n", green);
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: blue is %d.\n", blue);
    tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: clear is %d.\n", clear);
    if (g_flag != 0)
    {
        tcs34725_interface_debug_print("tcs34725: find interrupt.\n");

        break;
    }
    
    ...
    
}

...
